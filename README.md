## Install

Soon it will be ready

## Usage

```sh
‚ùØ t-rec
```

or with specifying a different program to launch

```sh
‚ùØ t-rec /bin/sh
```

### Hidden Gems

You can record not only the terminal but also every other window. There 2 ways to do so:

1) for example lets record a window 'Google Chrome'
2) make sure chrome is running and visible on screen

```sh
‚ùØ TERM_PROGRAM="google chrome" t-rec
tmp path: "/var/folders/m8/084p1v0x4770rpwpkrgl5b6h0000gn/T/trec-74728.rUxBx3ohGiQ2"
Press Ctrl+D to end recording
[src/window_id.rs:122] window_owner = "Google Chrome 2"
```

this is how it looks then:
